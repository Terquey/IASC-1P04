### About the Game

A Cold Embrace is a game about life after a winter apocalypse. The past few weeks have been rough for you, and you desperately need both food, and firewood. Are you up to the challange? Can you survive the eternal winter? There's only one way to find out. Inspired by The Long Dark, A Cold Embrace is meant to give you the same sense of impending doom and isolation. Is it still worth struggling to survive if there's no one left for you to meet?
